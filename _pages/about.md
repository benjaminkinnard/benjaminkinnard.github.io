Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Emory University. My research focuses on American institutions broadly, examining questions of agency problems and representation in various contexts, including Congress, the executive branch, and local politics.

I grew up in Pensacola, FL, and received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Political Science in 2020 from the University of West Florida.
