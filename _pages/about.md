Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Emory University. My research focuses on American institutions broadly, examining questions of agency problems and representation in various contexts, including Congress, the executive branch, and local politics. I study how Congress constrains the executive branch through various means, such as oversight and policymaking, and how the political environment conditions and congressional capacity condition Congress's ability and willingness to conduct oversight.

I grew up in Pensacola, FL, and received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Political Science in 2020 from the University of West Florida.

Outside of the academy, I enjoy trying new restaurants in Atlanta, hiking, and Japanese culture.
