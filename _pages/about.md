Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Emory University. I examine accountability, responsiveness, and separation of powers in American political institutions, including Congress, the executive branch, and local governments. 

My primary focus is congressional oversight of the executive branch, examining the political and non-political factors that motivate congressional oversight and the responsiveness of federal agencies to said oversight. I am also interested in the internal organization of Congress and its implications for the efficacy and policy outcomes of Congress, as well as the intersection of local government institutions and voter behavior.

I grew up in Pensacola, FL, and received my B.A. in Political Science in 2020 from the University of West Florida.

Outside of the academy, I enjoy trying new restaurants in Atlanta, hiking, and Japanese culture.
